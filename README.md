# Blog Website üìù

This is a simple **Blog Website** built using **Node.js** and **EJS** templating engine. The project was designed to experiment with server-side rendering and to explore how to integrate **MongoDB** for storing blog posts (though the MongoDB connection is currently disabled).

## Features ‚ú®

- **Server-side Rendering**: The website is rendered using EJS templates.
- **Node.js Backend**: Handles routing, rendering, and (formerly) database connections.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Implemented (but currently inactive due to MongoDB disconnection) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Node.js**: Backend framework.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for server-side rendering.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB (disconnected)**: Initially used for data persistence, but not currently connected.

## Project Status üöß

This project is currently not functional due to the disconnection from MongoDB. It was built as a learning project to explore EJS and Node.js, and can be reconnected to MongoDB or other databases in the future.
